### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Before starting these exercises, please create one github repository that you will use to paste your terminal history into after each exercise,
- Call it ‚ÄúGym Git Exercise Solutions‚Äù or similar. Make sure it has a readme file,
- The process for solving the exercises is as follows:
- First try to solve the exercise on your own (without peaking into the solution!). You are allowed google git commands, if you don‚Äôt remember them or if you need to read up on them.
- Next watch the solution video for the exercise you just completed.
- If you feel you may have done some things wrong, do the exercise again. But while you are doing it again, don‚Äôt peak at the video. Do it from memory.
- Now you can watch the video again (possibly at double speed, or skipping to the bits that you have doubts about) to double check if you did everything right this time.
- If you feel you still had mistakes, do the exercise again. Again, do it from memory, don‚Äôt peak at the video. And then afterwards check the video again etc. etc.
- Once you are confident that you have got the right solution, copy the terminal commands you used in your last try and past them in the readme file of the ‚ÄúGym Git Exercise Solutions‚Äù repository you have created. All Solutions to all exercises should be pasted into the readme file of this repository. Even when an exercise requires you to create a github repository for the purposes of solving the exercise, nevertheless always use the ‚ÄúGym Git Exercise Solutions‚Äù readme file to paste your terminal history into.
